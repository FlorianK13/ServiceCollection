# NFDI4Energy Best Practices Service
**From the NFDI4Energy Proposal:** This key service will provide an overview of good practices of research data management and usage in research projects, list training courses, e.g. on software engineering for non-computer scientists, and give guidelines for using the other services of nfdi4energy. Successful examples of cross-institutional research data management provide a low-threshold offer, which is complemented by mapping community standards collected through surveys and information to support the establishment of the FAIR standards through domain-specific guidelines and recommendations, e.g. on licensing.
