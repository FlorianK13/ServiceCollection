# NFDI4Energy Simulation Service
**From the NFDI4Energy Proposal:** The Simulation service provides Simulation-as-a-Service (SaaS) capabilities on the platform as well as support for “on premise” distributed (co)-simulation and hardware-in-the-loop simulation facilitated by community-driven harmonisation of simulation interface standards. The creation and use of simulations by noncomputer scientists are key goals, e.g. for the Citizen Science aspects of the nfdi4energy project but also for supporting multi domain models for experts from various energy domains. Distributed simulations, enabling the combination of different domains, abstraction layers, and increased performance, have to be supported by an improved simulation middleware. We build on existing co-simulation tools for close or tight simulation coupling like mosaik and interface exchange standards like the functional mockup interface (FMI). In order to achieve loose coupling and facilitating even larger scenarios, we will adapt existing approaches from the mobility domain. For hardware-in-the-loop simulation, we will incorporate the VILLAS framework, which enables the coupling of different laboratories for hardware-in-the-loop simulation. Furthermore, we will follow an ontology-based approach for including necessary semantic knowledge from the Registry service to assist in simulation creation and validation, heavily relying on our own related work from Schwarz and Lehnhoff. While favouring an open source ecosystem, the Simulation service also supports the integration of non-open datasets and non-open source software to support intellectual property (IP) exploitation.
