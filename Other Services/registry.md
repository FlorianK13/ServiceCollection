# NFDI4Energy Registry Service
**From the NFDI4Energy Proposal:** A registry for metadata for DOs like research data and software, based on existing approaches like the OEP, is developed based on an intense requirement engineering and involvement process for the community (TA4, TA5, requirements: TA1). Registry supports the creation and continuous integration of appropriate metadata based on standards and controlled vocabularies like the OEO (partly developed by the RLI), SARGON, and other relevant standards. The Registry service will be based on existing general services like the PID-Services of the TIB45, DataCite, DOI, ORCID, and the TS of TIB. Access restrictions for data and software will be considered. The Registry service supports researchers in finding the right input data, existing models, and scenarios. We will include existing datasets from all co-applicants into our registry and integrate the whole community. For storing data, the Registry service will recommend existing repositories like the OED, which is a community developed and hosted PostgreSQL database for open energy system research with a RESTful API specifically designed for storing high temporal resolution data.
