# NFDI4Energy Service Definition
This site collects services that are either used or developed within the [NFDI4Energy project](https://nfdi4energy.uol.de/). In the following, different ways to categorize these services are discussed. If you are interested in the service collection, check out [NFDI4Energy Service Categories](/categories).

## Categorization of Services

### Categorization based on the NFDI4Energy proposal
In the NFDI4Energy [proposal](https://zenodo.org/records/6772013), a Research & Tranfser Cycle is defined. It introduces the following categories:

Based on this Research & Tranfser Cycle, **Core Services** are defined:

| Category       | Definition                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Competence     | help to navigate the interdisciplinary research field                                                                                                                |
| Best Practices | get information on successful conduct of research in the field of energy systems and their research data management                                                  |
| Registry       | find suitable data sets and software modules                                                                                                                         |
| Simulation     | couple existing simulations and, therefore, increase the reuse of software artefacts                                                                                 |
| Transparency   | involve more stakeholders in all research stages, especially integrating their data, and to convey the appropriate key research results to all relevant stakeholders |

### Categorization based on the `Data Life Cycle`

A more data-centric approach is used when defining a data life cycle. It consists of the six steps:

* planning
* production
* analysis
* storage
* access
* re-use

### Categorization based on the Serice Source

Services can also be categorized based on who created and maintains those services. Here we could use the sources:

* source/nfdi4energy
* source/oef
* source/base4nfdi
* source/other

### Categorization based on the DFG Definitions
These categories are relevant for the DFG reporting. They can be accessed from the nfdi1000 Excel sheet [here](https://www.dfg.de/de/foerderung/foerderinitiativen/nfdi/formulare-merkblaetter) and the [Guide](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-initiative/nfdi/guide-to-filling-out-the-supplementary-data-sheet-for-consortia-of-the-national-research-data-infrastructure-nfdi-)

First, Categories are defined based on the [de.NBI](https://zenodo.org/records/6597826) definitions (see Drop Down Categories from the reporting excel sheet, Tab 5)

| Category             | Definition                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Database             | software providing large amounts of structured data to the user. Usually the data can be uploaded, accessed, searched and/or downloaded via a web browser. |
| Library / API        | collection of pre‐implemented functions for a specific task that can be accessed via a well‐ defined interfaces.                                           |
| Workflow             | software that combines multiple tools / applications. They may be used locally or remotely via the internet.                                               |
| Tools / applications | software that can be downloaded and executed locally on the users' hardware.                                                                               |
| Web applications     | software that is installed on a server and can be used by users via a web page and the internet.                                                           |
| Storage              | Not defined by de.NBI                                                                                                                                      |
| Data Curation        | Not defined by de.NBI                                                                                                                                      |

de.NBI additionally defines `Support / consulting` as "service with direct user contact for topics going beyond the support for the other services".
