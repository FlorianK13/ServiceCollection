# NFDI4Energy Competence Service
**From the NFDI4Energy Proposal:** Building on the platform EnArgus, which gives an extensive overview on over 30,000 energy research projects, a database of scientific institutes, scientists, and relevant industrial partners will be created. It will be used as a foundation and reference point for metadata of the different DOs in the other services. The database will be searchable and can also help to identify the right research and transfer partners like scientists and companies for upcoming research projects.
