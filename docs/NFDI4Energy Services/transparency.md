# NFDI4Energy Transparency Service
**From the NFDI4Energy Proposal:** The Transparency service supports the comparability of scenarios, reflects social and societal aspects and needs and integrates components from Citizen Science. Thus, this service plays an important role for the identification of new research questions and societal challenges occurring in energy system research and transformation. In science, results are regularly published in scientific journals as well as on academic conferences. While these options mainly reach other scientists, in the context of the energy systemsâ€™ transition, it is important to convey new information to the general public as well as into businesses, from both ongoing and finished research projects. Therefore, the Transparency service will be used within the whole research and transfer cycle and is the place to present simulation plans and discuss them with the society, industry, and scientific community.
